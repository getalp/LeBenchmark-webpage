<span style="font-size:25px">LeBenchmark: A Reproducible Framework for Assessing Self-Supervised Representation Learning (SSL) from Speech</span>

**LeBenchmark** is a reproducible and multifaceted benchmark for evaluating speech SSL models. We propose an initial set of four tasks, measuring specific speech challenges in French language:  Speech Recognition (ASR), Spoken Language Understanding (SLU), Speech Translation (AST) and  Emotion Recognition (AER).

A leaderboard will be updated frequently [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/leaderboard/).
